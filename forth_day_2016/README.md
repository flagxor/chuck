# Forth Day 2016

* [video](https://youtu.be/FeZ-40fxY48?t=8458)
* Forthless Forth
* GA144, don't want to use a lot of nodes
   * Don't need to compile over and over if I can decompile
   * Read 5-bit and generate a word
   * Lost interest and went on to other things
   * Had in mind an editor you could move in the code
   * Was able to display some toy object + source
* Got iPhone
   * I'll do this on the iPhone
   * Bought an mini mac
   * A counter
   * Was very unhappy doing this
   * Wanted to generate object code, but no way I can do this
   * Hoped to combine apps
   * Wasn't fun
   * Toolchains complex, ill documented
   * Same on the mac
* Maybe there's another way
   * Bought a Raspberry Pi
   * Got my Forth on to it
   * Bare metal Forth on the Pi
   * Could put an image up on the monitor
   * Could put up my source code
   * Decompiled from object code
   * Used the I/O interface with 3 key keyboard
   * Quad core, couldn't talk to the other core
   * Couldn't talk to the GPU other than display image
   * Could figure out how to talk to the USB
   * No documentation for anything
   * It wasn't fun, all the time searching the internet
   * I feel marginalized
   * They'd have to document their system
       * Undocumented conglomerations
       * Rely in internet hackers to reverse engineer
   * It's a lousy world
* Returned to the GA144
* Greg has an IP interface, 10 nodes
   * Do that and get on the internet, move in that direction
   * Have a USB, but can only talk to keyboard
* Not real motivated
   * Threw away my soldering iron
   * Threw away my oscilloscope
* At 10nm that would be 40,000 GA nodes
* Even at 14nm
   * You submit your geometry, they convert
* Your file has to vetted by their design rule check
* At MOSIS 5 people could produce a chip and get 10 back
* Hardware people aren't innovating, putting other peoples things on a chip
* I used to think there was a conspiracy
   * Now I think people just don't want to document things
* Haven't heard anything about colorForth today
   * That's why colorforth.com went away
   * colorFroth was a good idea, but I've got other things to do
   * colorForth is a good thing, but I think decompiler is the way to go
