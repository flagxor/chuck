# Forth Day 2014

* [video](https://youtu.be/NjX9acIN7RA?t=11085)
* The map is not the territory, this is not a pipe
* First Forth processed strings
* Then indirect threaded code
* Then subroutine threaded code
* Then colorForth
   * Pre-parsed source code
   * Shannon encoded characters (neat trick no great value)
   * Weird keyboard (nobody will use except me [Chuck])
   * Moved compiler to the editor
* About 6 nodes to make a GA144 be able to compile its own code
* Eliminate the compiler, have a good decompiler, edit the object code
   * Tried to do this 5-8 years ago
   * Need a wrapper: dictionary, maybe control flow, tools
   * Decompiler needs to work at 60Hz
   * Hopes to show next year (2014)
* MegaForths and MicroForths
   * PolyForth is a MegaForth
* Audio cuts out :-(
